## 🎓 What Is This Project?
Congratulations! You’ve completed the course in the simulator. Now it’s time to test your skills with a new machine learning task. You’ll work on this project independently.

Once you finish, submit it for review. You’ll receive feedback within 24 hours. Then revise your project and resubmit it.

You’ll likely go through several rounds of revisions — that’s perfectly normal.

The project is complete once all revisions are approved.

## 📌 Project Description
The mobile operator Megaline discovered that many customers are still using outdated plans. They want to build a system that analyzes customer behavior and recommends one of the two current plans: Smart or Ultra.

You have data on customers who have already switched to these plans. Your task is to build a classification model that predicts the most suitable plan.

You’ve already completed data preprocessing — no need to repeat it.

Build a model with the highest possible accuracy. To pass the project, your model must achieve at least 0.75 accuracy on the test set. You’ll need to evaluate this yourself.

## 🛠️ Project Instructions
1. Open and explore the dataset: File path: /datasets/users_behavior.csv

2. Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

3. Experiment with different models and hyperparameters. Write brief conclusions about your findings.

4. Evaluate the final model on the test set.

## ⭐ Bonus Task
Check your model for sanity (i.e., whether it makes reasonable predictions). Don’t worry if it’s difficult — this dataset is more complex than previous ones. You’ll learn more about this in the next course.

## 📋 Data Description
Each row in the dataset represents one user’s monthly behavior. The features include:

- calls — number of calls

- minutes — total call duration in minutes

- messages — number of SMS messages

- mb_used — internet usage in megabytes

- is_ultra — which plan the user used that month (1 for Ultra, 0 for Smart)

## ✅ How Will My Project Be Evaluated?
Reviewers will assess:

- How you explore the data after loading it

- Whether you correctly split the data into sets

- How you choose the sizes of those sets

- Whether you evaluate model quality properly

- Which models and hyperparameters you use

- What conclusions you draw from your experiments

- Whether you test the model correctly

- Whether your model achieves high accuracy

- Whether your project is well-structured and your code is clean

Everything you need is covered in previous lessons and cheat sheets.

Good luck! 🚀
